# Exclusive Summary

The purpose of this project is to help obese people and healthcare organizations explore the main causes of obesity. The team analyzed 2,111 health condition records from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, including 16 variables, and performed exploratory data analysis to fix outliers. In the process of predicting obesity, the team used linear regression, logistic regression, and CART models, and sought the best prediction model based on the generalization ability of the model. 

In the end, the team found that the CART model had the highest accuracy (78%), precision (77%), and recall (78%), which means that this model is the best model for predicting obesity. According to the results of the Cart model, age, height, frequency of vegetable consumption, number of main meals, and time using technological devices are the five most important indicators affecting obesity, with importance scores of 15.4%, 14.5%, 12.5%, 10.4%, and 8.9%, respectively.
