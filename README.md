# Personal-Practice

As part of my continuous learning, I seek to strengthen my skills in data, financial, and strategic analysis while refining my analytical approach. By applying Python, R, and SQL to real datasets, I practice extracting, cleaning, and modeling data, conducting customer and financial analysis, and generating insights to support strategic decision-making. These exercises not only enhance my technical proficiency but also sharpen my problem-solving mindset and help me improve my ability to integrate quantitative analysis with business perspectives. I also value opportunities for mutual exchange—sharing ideas and learning from others—to broaden perspectives and foster continuous growth together.
