# Exclusive Summary

In this project, I employed a variety of machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict house prices. The methodologies included linear regression, regularization techniques (such as Ridge and Lasso regression), decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

To start, I built and fine-tuned these models using a comprehensive dataset of Illinois house prices, leveraging feature engineering to improve model performance. Key features included square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and neighborhood characteristics. I performed extensive preprocessing, including handling missing data, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

For model evaluation and to ensure the robustness of my predictions, I implemented cross-validation using house price data from Wisconsin. This step involved splitting the Wisconsin dataset into training and test sets, ensuring the models generalized well to unseen data.

The project culminated in a comparative analysis of the model performances, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The neural network model, in particular, demonstrated superior performance due to its ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships within the data.

Overall, this project showcased the practical application of diverse machine learning techniques in real estate price prediction, emphasizing model accuracy and generalizability across different datasets.
